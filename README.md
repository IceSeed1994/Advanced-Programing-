1.  Introduction

1.1. Problem : Deep learning model for deep fake face recognition

The advancement of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has made remarkable progress in image recognition, object detection, and classification. Convolutional Neural Networks are a special type of artificial neural network, which are used in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as images. The use of CNNs has proven successful in several computer vision applications. The task of detecting whether an image is real or fake has gained importance due to the rise of deepfake technology, where individuals can create synthetic images or videos that look real. This technology has the potential to create a significant threat to privacy and security, making it necessary to develop methods to detect and identify deepfakes. In this report, we aim to build a CNN model to detect whether an image is real or fake. We use the dataset containing images of both real and fake faces to train and test our model. We evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, and discuss the results in detail.
